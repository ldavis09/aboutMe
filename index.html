      <h1> Laura's <em>Most</em> <b>Interesting</b> Interests
      </h1>
      <p> Honestly, my interests probably aren't <em><b>that</b></em> interesting. So, I thought that rather than hearing about my interests, people would be more interested in learning how one family has been in a house for 68 days (and counting) without completely losing our minds during the state-wide stay at home order we have been under. Spoiler: it involves lots of binge watching TV, home-schooling my children, a <em>giant</em> lap dog, and making long term plans for the future. </p>
